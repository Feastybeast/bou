# Bou

A sqlite migrations manager in the spirit of [caribou](https://github.com/clutchski/caribou).

First time users might be interested in the [Project Glossary](docs/glossary.md).

If you're looking at this, in it's current state, congratulations!
You found this in a state I considered worth putting on github so I don't lose it.

Mind the dust. Feature completeness, proper documentation, code linting and so forth coming eventually.
